- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cswish24
- 👀 I am a proficient programmer in python focused on building applications in python with Django at the moment, Though I do know some Flask
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data structures and algorithms in python, discrete mathematics, and Fast API
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my language learning application. Specifically I would like help designing a better UI/UX. This app is currently written in Python/Django Html CSS. If you have experience in HTML/CSS and want to contribute let me know. I am also open to migrating the frontend to JavaScript, though I am not entirely familliar with how to get a javascript front end to communicate with a python backend, but I am excited to learn how!
